Show/hide menu items with conditional statements

== Description ==

Simple plugin that adds extra functionality to Menu Items. The plugin will allow to show or hide menu items based on condition statements (Is single page, User is Logged In, etc).

The management is very easy, each menu item will have a "Enable Conditional Logic" check that will allow to select a conditional statement (Example in Screenshots)

Basic conditional statements are included in the plugin, other will be included in future releases or can be added by another plugins or themes.

Example of adding a new conditional statement is described in the FAQ section

== Installation ==

To install the plugin, follow the steps below

1. Upload `if-menu` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enable conditional statements for your Menu Items in Appearance -> Menus page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= If Menu is broken =

The code for modifying the menu items is limited and if other plugins/themes try to alter the menu items, this plugin will break.

This is an ongoing [issue with WordPress](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18584) which hopefully will be fixed in a future release.

Try to use just one plugin that changes the functionality for menu items.


= How can I add a conditinal statement for menu items? =

New conditional statements can be added by any other plugins or themes.

Example of adding a new conditional statement for disaplying/hiding a menu item when current page is a custom-post-type.

`
// theme's functions.php or plugin file
add_filter( 'if_menu_conditions', 'my_new_menu_conditions' );

function my_new_menu_conditions( $conditions ) {
  $conditions[] = array(
    'name'    =>  'If single custom-post-type', // name of the condition
    'condition' =>  function($item) {          // callback - must return TRUE or FALSE
      return is_singular( 'my-custom-post-type' );
    }
  );

  return $conditions;
}
`

= Where do I find conditional functions? =

WordPress provides [a lot of functions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags) which can be used to create conditional statements for almost any combination that a theme/plugin developer can think of.
